In MachineLearning, I have put most of the files that I've developed for classifying MRI images. In this, I explored unsupervised and supervised methods, however, we settled on using support vector machines. Scripts in this folder cover data preprocessing, processing, feature extraction, and analysis.

In the process of deciding which machine learning approaches we wanted to use for classifying moyamoya functional images, a lot of trial and error occured. As a result, this is probably my messiest github folder, but I think it is important, so I decided to put it up anyways.
