# MRI-Tools
These are MRI processing tools that I have written, mostly for myself.

One of my favorite outputs is the zstatMovie, so be sure to check out Donahue_208977_zstatMovie.mp4. This shows reactivity
to a vasoactive stimulus in Blood Oxygen Level Dependent MRI.

Additionally, each folder here represents a set of tools I've developed.

Some loose files are also shown here.
