# MRI-Tools
These are MRI processing tools that I have written, mostly for myself.

One of my favorite outputs is the zstatMovie, so be sure to check out Donahue_208977_zstatMovie.mp4. This shows reactivity
to a vasoactive stimulus in Blood Oxygen Level Dependent MRI.

Additionally, each folder here represents a set of tools I've developed.

Some loose files are also shown here.
- isoutlier_slw_v2.m is a function I wrote to determine outliers in a vector, because I wasn't happy with matlabs default function.
- keepupper.sh is a script I wrote to keep my remote desktop open, because it kept closing.
- pcasl_slw_v1.m is a script I wrote to put all the tools for processing pseudo Continuous Arterial Spin Labeling images, because I was sick of having seperate functions for this.
