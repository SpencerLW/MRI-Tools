Some loose files are also shown here.
- isoutlier_slw_v2.m is a function I wrote to determine outliers in a vector, because I wasn't happy with matlabs default function.
- keepupper.sh is a script I wrote to keep my remote desktop open, because it kept closing.
- pcasl_slw_v1.m is a script I wrote to put all the tools for processing pseudo Continuous Arterial Spin Labeling images, because I was sick of having seperate functions for this.
