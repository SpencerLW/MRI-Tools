ASE_standalone is a collection of tools written by me, and external resources, that are used to process Asymmetric Spin Echo MRI images.

This is the code that I used for my own study. The code for processing the Wash-U data, and what
we should give to Manus when I leave is /Users/spencerwaddle/Documents/SLWtools/SLW_ASEproc_v3
